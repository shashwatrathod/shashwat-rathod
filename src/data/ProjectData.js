      "The project is aimed at determining the type of activity being performed by the user (cycling, walking, & running) based on sensor data from their smartphone or smartwatch. We developed this project from the ground up; from data collection to model creation. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 95% on unseen data.",

It is an endless runner where the user controls a ball and bounces it off some raised platforms to earn points, collects coins on the way, and dodges all the enemies. The game also features power-ups and an in-game store.",

    date: "October, 2019",
    info: "The system uses a CNN model trained on more than 100,000 images to detect if a given parking spot is empty or occupied. The feed from CCTV cameras is passed through our system which analyzes it and determines the position of empty spots. This information is then updated to the firebase database and can further be reflected in a user application or on an LED board outside the parking lot to help customers find empty parking spots easily.",
